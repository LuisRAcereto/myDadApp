# myDadApp
This is a demo app that provides words of wisdom to children and others who need it. The story is that my kids have graduated and are moving on and I won't necessarily be there every morning to help them get thru the day. This application delivers a Dad joke when they need it.

## Deploy to Azure
I've included a deployment template you can use to provision the necessary infrastructure. 
This is a starter template for deploying a linux web app with deployment slots for STAGING that can be used for multi-stage deployment pipelines
